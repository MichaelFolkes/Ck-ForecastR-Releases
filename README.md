## Ck-ForecastR-Releases
Repository for major releases, feedback, and bug reports.

*Note*: The code for the *ForecastR* package is still under development, and
does not live here. When we get to a major release milestone, we will make the
code available here.  This repository is where the development team interacts with the End User Community.
