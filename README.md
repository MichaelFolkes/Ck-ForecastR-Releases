## Ck-ForecastR-Releases
Repository for major releases, feedback, and bug reports.

*Note*: The code for the *ForecastR* package is continuously evolving. Whenever we get to a major release milestone, we make the code available here.  This repository is where the development team interacts with the End User Community.

*ForecastR* is available in 2 configurations:

* Shiny App: Interactive interface for exploring and ranking alternative forecast models.
* R Package: Command line access to the computational engine.
